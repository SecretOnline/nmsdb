# License for all NMSDB projects

I'm not one for lawyer-speak, so I'll try to list the dos and don'ts without using overly confusing language.

If you want to discuss these terms, go ahead. This is a public project, so try to keep discussion about this stuff public too.

Throughout this text, first person pronouns (such as 'I', 'me', or 'us') refer to the original owners of the repository. In this case, that means [secret_online](https://secretonline.co).

# Dos

**Contribute** to it! You can clone, fork, add to, edit, or do almost whatever you like (within reason).

**Ask** if you have questions about this license. Seriously.

# Don'ts

**Commercialise** the project. It's here for the benefit of the community. Any forks must not be used for commercial purposes, as that was not the intention.

**Override** these terms. You're welcome to license your work how you like, but these terms must take priority. This is mostly to give you a bit of freedom with how you do your work, but prevents you from outright stealing by overriding the license.

**Redistribute**, unless explicitly stated by me. Don't steal from other people on the internet, it's not nice.

# Considerations

This section is just a couple of things about this license itself.

**Changes** to this license. If this license, or the license under which this repository is, is to change, then it is your responsibility to make sure you still adhere to the terms. The latest version of the license applies to all versions of the project.

**Questions** can be answered! If you have any questions about a specific scenario, or if there's any ambiguity, feel free to ask me.
